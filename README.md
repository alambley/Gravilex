# Gravilex
My final program for CS333 Programming and Problem Solving in C++. Basically a C++ implementation of Gravilex, an amalgamation of Connect 4 and Scrabble where you drop letters onto a vertical board and try to make words and gain points based on how long the word is. Includes an exhaustive AI opponent.

# How to build/play
  
  Includes a makefile, so just make and then start the attached bash file to start playing.
